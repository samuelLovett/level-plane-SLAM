# Level Plane SLAM: Out-of-plane Motion Compensation in a Globally Stabilized Coordinate Frame for 2D SLAM

## Description
Welcome to the **Level Plane SLAM: Out-of-plane Motion Compensation in a Globally Stabilized Coordinate Frame for 2D SLAM** repository! This repository occompanies IEEE conference paper of the same name found here https://doi.org/10.1109/SMC53992.2023.10394614. The project is currently under construction. We are working hard to ensure the code meets ROS package standards before making it publicly available.

## Status
**Under Review**

The code in this repository is not yet finalized. Please check back later for updates. We appreciate your patience and understanding.

## Updates
We will post updates here as the review progresses. Stay tuned for the latest information.
